# X4 Player Ship Trade Analyzer

![Title](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4PlayerShipTradeAnalyzer/refs/heads/main/docs/images/title360.jpg)

A simple, fast desktop tool for X4: Foundations players to understand their ship's trading performance. Point it at your game folder and a save file and get clear insights into:

- Which wares make you the most profit
- How each of your ships has been trading over time
- Totals for price, quantity, and estimated profit per transaction

**Important notice**: Please be aware - trade logs are collected by game for AI pilots only.

The app runs locally and reads only your X4 files. Nothing is uploaded. **Nothing is MODDED!**

## Key features

- Two analysis modes:
  - By Transactions: Each buy/sell action is analyzed separately. This is faster and shows more data, but profit is estimated based on average prices.
  - By Trades: Profit is calculated based on actual trades (buy+sell). This method is more accurate for profit calculation, but may show fewer entries if some ships haven't completed trades yet.
- Ships transactions/trades: A detailed table of every transaction/trade in your save
  - Columns for Transactions: Time, Sector, Station, Operation (Buy/Sell), Product, Price, Quantity, Total, Estimated Profit
  - Columns for Trades: Time, Product, Bought, Sold, Profit, Spent Time.
    - Columns for related Transactions: Time, Operation, Volume, Price, Sector, Station
- Transactions filters for ware type: Container, Solid, Liquid, Gas
- Trades filter: With Internal Trades (i.e. trades between your stations can be excluded)
- Ships graphs: Compare ships visually
  - Interactive chart per ship; double-click a ship in the list to toggle it on/off
  - Same Container/Solid/Liquid/Gas filters can be applied
- Wares stats: See what actually makes money
  - Single-series histogram with per-ware colors and tooltips
  - Custom legend shows color + ware name for quick scanning
- Ships by Wares: See which ships trade which wares
  - Stacked column chart with ships on X-axis and wares colored
  - Sorted by profit in descending order
  - Same Container/Solid/Liquid/Gas filters can be applied
- Wares by Ships: See which wares are traded by which ships
  - Same as above, but with wares on X-axis and ships colored
  - Sorted by profit in descending order
  - Same Container/Solid/Liquid/Gas filters can be applied

## Video

There is short video available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBRmOO3SDUA) demonstrating the app's features and usage.

## Tips & troubleshooting

- I see zeros / tabs are disabled
  - Make sure you set both Game Folder (X4.exe) and a valid save `.xml.gz`, then press both Reload buttons.

- Save not found
  - Check `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Egosoft\X4\<player-id>\save\` for `quicksave.xml.gz` or any `*.xml.gz` save.

- Loading takes a while
  - Large saves can take a minute. A small progress window appears during import.

- Nothing uploads anywhere
  - The app reads your local files only and keeps all analysis on your machine.
